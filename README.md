# How long will it take for different amounts of water to boil?

Satisfying some kid curiosity with a simple experiment.

Digital version as originally entered is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_nJDC9l_DNOoHIGQe65XFBQ6UC-p4aLXUBWBKLjuqKo/edit?usp=sharing), as well as [tidy csv version](boiling_times.csv) used to make our plots.

We decided to do two trials for each amount of water, but got bored towards the end.

# Results

It looks like the water heats up slightly faster in the beginning and then it slows down as it gets close to boiling. The water boiled slightly below 212 F according to our thermometer. Maybe our thermometer isn't measuring things correctly?

It looks like doubling the amount of water just about doubles the boiling time.

# Notes for next time

Next time we would first measure the steady boiling temperature for our setup and then used that to record the first time our water hits that temperature. We thought it would be 212 F, but it ended up being more like 209 F. We'd also let the water sit in the pot for a bit before our first measurement to keep the initial temperatures more similar.
